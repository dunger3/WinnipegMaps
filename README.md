Winnipeg Maps App

Developer: Dillon Unger
Status: In Development
Platform: Android (Jetpack Compose, Kotlin)

🗺️ Overview

Winnipeg Maps App is a custom-built mapping application using Google Maps Compose, Firestore, and Firebase-style authentication.
It provides an interactive experience for both guests and authenticated users, offering features such as:

Saving personal favorite locations

Community alert posting

Viewing nearby places (gyms, pizza, video game stores)

Route drawing using Google Routes API

Reverse geocoding to display real-world addresses

The app is built with modular screens, clean architecture, and real-time Firestore syncing.

🧩 Features
👤 Guest vs Logged-In Mode

  Guests can explore the map but cannot:
  
  Save favorites
  
  Delete/rename locations
  
  Draw routes
  
  Create community alerts
  
  Logged-in users get full functionality, including:
  
  Adding/editing/removing favorites
  
  Creating alerts
  
  Drawing routes
  
  Viewing addresses for favorites & markers

⭐ Favorites System (Firestore-Synced)

  Tap the map in "Add Mode" to save a new favorite.
  
  Rename or delete favorites from the Map Options menu.
  
  Each favorite resolves a reverse-geocoded address at runtime (not stored in Firestore).
  
  Favorites automatically sync using Firestore listeners.

🚨 Community Alerts

  Long-press the map to create an alert at that location.
  
  Or use the Add Alert option to create a draft, then click anywhere to place it.
  
  Alerts are visible to all users (community feature).
  
  Firestore-based real-time sync.

🚗 Route Drawing (Google Routes API)

  Select a start and end favorite using a clean popup dialog.
  
  Fetches the optimal driving route using the modern Routes API v2.
  
  Draws a polyline on the map.
  
  Includes loading, error handling, and route clearing.

🏬 Places Search (Google Places API)

  Toggle categories from a top-center legend:
  
  Gyms
  
  Video game stores
  
  Pizza restaurants
  
  Each toggle triggers a Nearby Search centered on the map’s camera position.
  Markers are color-coded and do not require login.

📍 Reverse Geocoding (Google Geocoding API or Geolocate v2)

  Clicking a favorite loads and displays its full address.
  
  Temporary markers also display addresses (if enabled).
  
  Addresses are cached in-memory using FavoriteRepository.FavoriteAddressCache.
